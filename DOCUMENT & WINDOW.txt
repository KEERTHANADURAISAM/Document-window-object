                                           			    Document                                                                            window

It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.               It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   


It is loaded inside the window.                                                                			  It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

												
It is the object of window property.                                                                                     It is the object of the browser.



All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.                         Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.


We can access the document from a window using the window. document                       We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window


The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom                                         The window is part of BOM, not DOM.

(Document object model)


Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc                                        Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
